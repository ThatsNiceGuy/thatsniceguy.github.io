# ThatsNiceGuy's Website
A website made by me about myself. Will replace my main website at some point in time.

Since I'm a beginner at HTML, CSS and just web design in general, some of the source is garbage and I hope to improve it while learning.

### Completion
- [x] Basic page style
- [ ] Move to using CSS files instead of inline CSS
  - really important
- [ ] Add more social links
- [ ] Custom fonts instead of the plain text
- [ ] Mobile formatting

Much more to come in the future

### Contents of website
- Basic online presence
- My iOS shortcuts
- Link to main website
